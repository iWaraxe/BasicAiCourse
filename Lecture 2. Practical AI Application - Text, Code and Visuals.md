## Lecture 2. Practical AI Application - Text, Code and Visuals
### 1. Introduction: From Theory to Practice

#### 1.1. Script

"Welcome back, everyone! I hope you enjoyed your first deep dive into the world of AI in our previous lecture. We met the major players—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Mistral—and discovered that, while these systems are impressive, they're far from perfect. We also explored the boundaries of AI by witnessing firsthand its biases, hallucinations, and occasional lapses in logic.

Today, we're flipping the perspective. Instead of focusing on what AI **can't** do, we’ll explore what it **can** do—really well. This lecture is all about **practical applications**. We're going hands-on with how modern AI can help us write, translate, code, debug, analyze visuals, and even extract insights from documents.

Our focus is not just on results, but also on comparing how different tools perform the same tasks. You’ll see real prompts in action, and you'll get to try them yourself. By the end of the session, you’ll have a clearer picture of how to use AI as a smart assistant across different domains.

So—ready to put theory into practice? Let’s begin."
