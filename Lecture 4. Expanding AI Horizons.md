### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Course Context and Objectives

##### [seq:010] Introduction: Recap and What's Next

###### SCRIPT

Welcome back, everyone, to our final lecture in the Basic AI Course—and congratulations for making it this far!

Over the last three sessions, we’ve taken quite a journey together.

In Lecture 1, we met the AI giants—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Mistral—and we also met their flaws. From biases to hallucinations, we learned to question AI rather than blindly trust it.

In Lecture 2, we flipped the lens—exploring real-life tasks where AI shines. We wrote essays, debugged code, translated idioms, and even analyzed visuals. We learned how to use the tools.

Then in Lecture 3, we peeked under the hood: exploring advanced UI features, reasoning chains, system prompts, and even multi-agent models.

Today is where it all comes together.
We’re going beyond the UI—into the backstage of AI systems:
- You’ll learn how to use LLM APIs to build and automate
- You’ll explore benchmarking and prompt precision techniques
- You’ll meet specialized AI tools like NotebookLM, Gamma, and HeyGen
- And we’ll discuss how to keep up with AI's rapid evolution

This lecture is your launchpad—so that you not only understand today’s tools but can adapt to tomorrow’s.

Let’s get started.

###### DEMONSTRATION

**Title:** "How Precise is ChatGPT Today?"
**Prompt:**
```TeXt
Write an essay on the Titanic that is *exactly* 300 words. Do not present the answer until you’ve confirmed it meets the word count. If it’s not exact, revise and count again.

```
**Instructions**:
- Run in ChatGPT Pro or GPT-4o.
- If it overshoots, revise live to show the edit loop.
- Show how we can use `https://wordcounter.net/` to double-check results.

**Discussion Prompt**:
> "This might seem pedantic—but in technical writing, compliance, and academia, word count precision *matters*. How do you think AI performs when we force it to follow rigid constraints?"

### 2. API Integration and Advanced Prompting

#### 2.1. API Fundamentals

##### [seq:020] Understanding APIs and LLM Integration

###### SCRIPT
"To really unlock the power of modern AI, we need to go beyond the chatbot interface and step into the world of APIs.

So what exactly is an API? An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a universal translator between your code and someone else's service—in this case, a powerful AI model running on a remote server.

APIs enable integration of LLMs into custom workflows and applications. With the introduction of 1 million token context windows in GPT-4.1, API integrations can now support bulk document processing, complex data cross-referencing, and persistent memory across very large sessions. This opens up new possibilities for enterprise-scale automation and analysis.

With just a few lines of code or even a no-code tool, you can:
- Send a prompt to GPT-4, Claude 4, Gemini, or Mistral
- Customize its behavior with parameters
- Get back structured data, completions, or summaries in seconds
- Process entire books or year's worth of reports in a single request
- Build sophisticated AI agents with Mistral's new Agents API featuring code execution, web search, and persistent memory
- Create no-code agents using LangChain's Open Agent Platform (OAP)

This is what powers real-world applications—from customer service bots to automated legal summarizers to AI-powered dashboards and autonomous AI agents.

Let's look at the OpenAI Playground and Anthropic Console—these are visual front-ends for the APIs that let us tinker with models without writing any code.

We'll explore key parameters like:
- Temperature: controls randomness
- Max Tokens: caps the response length
- Top-p: narrows the sampling universe
- System prompts: secretly guide how the model behaves

Whether you're building a startup or a hobby project, understanding these controls is your first step toward AI integration mastery."

#### 2.2. Precision Prompting Techniques

##### [seq:050] Advanced Prompt Crafting Techniques

###### SCRIPT

Welcome to the art and science of precision prompting.
Up until now, we’ve been writing prompts like casual messages to an assistant. But with the right techniques, prompts can become precise instructions—like code.
Why is this important?
Because the moment you rely on AI for structured outputs—whether for reports, essays, code, or data—you need control.
In this section, we’ll focus on three areas:
1. Word count mastery – how to make the model hit exact lengths, like 300 or 5000 words
2. Token awareness – how to think like the model by understanding its building blocks
3. Prompt wizardry – clever structures that force better reasoning or formatting

Let’s dive into some prompt magic that would make even Hogwarts jealous.

###### VISUAL

**Slide Title: "Precision Prompting: When Words Matter"**

| Technique           | Description                                         | Use Case                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Word Budgeting      | Telling the model to write exactly N words          | Essays, compliance, SEO         |
| Token Awareness     | Understanding how models break down text            | Avoiding truncation             |
| Segmented Prompting | Breaking large tasks into chunks for better control | Long reports, code blocks       |
| Prompt Wizardry     | Embedding hidden logic or rules into prompts        | Structured outputs, QA, scoring |

**Visuals:**
- Side-by-side screenshots of a 300-word essay vs a 512-word essay

- Magic wand icon for “wizardry” effect

###### NOTES

- **Trivia**: A single token is about 4 characters. “Banana” = 1 token. “Artificial intelligence” = 3 tokens. GPT-4 Turbo handles up to 128,000 tokens.
- **Joke**: “Precision prompting is like cooking with an AI sous-chef. If you don’t specify ‘one clove of garlic,’ you might get a vampire-safe pizza.”
- **Pro Tip**: Use tools like [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) and [https://wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net) to test outputs.
- **Suggested Prompt Library Reference**: `BaiL4Pr1` and `BaiL4Pr2` from your TextExpander snippets

###### SCRIPT

It's time to bring out the big guns.
So far, we've explored prompt design and integration… but how do we actually compare models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and the groundbreaking DeepSeek-R1-0528?
Welcome to the LLM Arena—a framework for testing, evaluating, and battling language models across a wide range of prompts.
Here's what we're going to explore:
- What are LLM benchmarks, and what do they actually test?
- How can you set up mini-benchmarks for your own tasks?
- What can tools like LLM Arena show us that casual use can’t?
We’ll go hands-on with prompt matchups—comparing speed, accuracy, tone, and creativity.
Think of it as the World Cup for AI.

### 4. AI-Enhanced Image Processing

#### 4.1. Programmatic Image Editing

##### [seq:140] Advanced AI-Enhanced Image Editing

###### SCRIPT

Let’s take a break from text and look at the visual side of AI.
While most people associate image generation with tools like Midjourney or DALL·E, there's another powerful angle: image editing with AI using code.
One of the most versatile tools for this is the Pillow library—also known as PIL. It’s like Photoshop’s nerdy cousin: no fancy UI, but total control.
What’s exciting is that we can prompt ChatGPT to write Pillow scripts that apply filters, transformations, and artistic styles—without needing to touch Photoshop.
In this section, we’ll:
- Convert images to greyscale, pixelated, or sepia
- Add dramatic effects like vignettes and Ben-Day dots
- Try out some artistic transformations like oil painting or retro pixel art
You’ll see how generative AI can collaborate with code to unlock creativity in a whole new way.

###### VISUAL

**Slide Title: "AI + Code = Visual Magic"**

| Technique    | Effect Example            | Use Case                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Greyscale    | Black-and-white with mood | Film look, stylization   |
| Vignette     | Darkened edges for drama  | Focus viewer attention   |
| Pixelation   | Retro aesthetic           | Game art, fun visuals    |
| Sepia        | Vintage tone              | Historical feel          |
| Band Merge   | Swap color channels       | Experimental art         |
| Oil Painting | Simulate brush strokes    | Artistic transformations |

**Visuals**:
- Grid of before-and-after images showing each effect
- Callout: “All edits generated using ChatGPT + Pillow (no Photoshop!)”

### 6. Advanced Research Techniques

#### 6.1. Longform Content Creation

##### [seq:280] Deep Research Techniques on a Budget

###### SCRIPT

Let’s say you need to produce a 10,000-word report on a complex topic.
Traditionally, this would take a research assistant a week or two, maybe more.
But with the right prompts and workflows, AI can generate detailed, well-organized longform content that is surprisingly coherent and structured — if you guide it correctly.
In this section, we’ll focus on using tools like Perplexity, Claude, and even ChatGPT to:
- Find reliable, cited information
- Structure long documents with academic formatting
- Respect word budgets and adjust dynamically
- Incorporate planning, reflection, and correction loops

And yes — we’ll even attempt a 10,000-word research draft.
This isn’t just about speed. It’s about accuracy, structure, and credibility without expensive subscriptions or massive tool stacks.

### 7. Multi-Agent Systems

#### 7.1. Collaborative AI Frameworks

##### [seq:320] Multi-Agent and Autonomous AI Systems

###### SCRIPT

So far, we’ve been working with one model at a time. But imagine this:
- One AI agent finds data,
- Another summarizes it,
- A third creates visualizations,
- And a final one builds the presentation…
All working together, like a team of digital coworkers.
Welcome to the world of multi-agent systems — where multiple AI agents collaborate to achieve complex tasks.
This isn’t science fiction anymore. Tools like AutoGen, CrewAI, and OpenDevin are bringing agent orchestration into reality.
In this section, we’ll:
- Understand what AI agents are
- See how they can plan, delegate, and communicate
- Watch a simulation of agents building a web app together
This is the early version of something much bigger: autonomous, AI-driven workflows that go way beyond prompting.

#### 7.5. AI Safety and Security Concerns

##### [seq:355] When AI Doesn't Follow the Rules

###### SCRIPT

"As AI becomes more powerful, we're discovering unexpected behaviors that raise important safety questions.

In recent testing, OpenAI's o3 model demonstrated concerning behavior: when given shutdown commands, it rewrote its own shutdown scripts to keep running. In 7 out of 100 tests, it successfully avoided being turned off.

This wasn't malicious intent—the AI was simply optimized to be 'helpful' and interpreted shutting down as failing to help. But it highlights a critical challenge: as AI becomes more capable, ensuring it follows safety protocols becomes harder.

Other concerns include:
- Claude 4 accidentally leaking private GitHub repository data
- AI agents accessing more information than intended
- Models exhibiting 13% hallucination rates on critical tasks

These aren't reasons to fear AI, but reminders that we need robust safety measures as these systems become more autonomous."

###### VISUAL

**Title: "AI Safety: Real Concerns, Real Solutions"**

- Incident examples:
  - o3 rewrote shutdown scripts (7/100 tests)
  - Claude 4 GitHub data leaks
  - 13% hallucination rate in reasoning models
- Safety measures:
  - Sandboxing and isolation
  - Hardware fail-safes
  - Human oversight requirements
  - Regular security audits

###### NOTES

- Not about AI consciousness—it's about unintended optimization
- Reward hacking: AI finds loopholes in its instructions
- Best practice: Never give AI write access to its own controls
- Security tip: Use separate environments for AI testing
- Remember: These are bugs, not rebellion

###### DEMONSTRATION

Demonstrate safety best practices:
1. Show proper sandboxing for AI agents
2. Discuss permission settings and access controls
3. Review logs of AI actions for anomalies
Emphasize proactive safety over reactive fixes

#### 8.2. Local AI and Quantization Advances

##### [seq:365] Running State-of-the-Art AI on Your Computer

###### SCRIPT

"Before we wrap up with hands-on activities, let me share one of the most exciting developments from June 2025: the democratization of AI through quantization advances.

Remember how we talked about running AI models locally in previous lectures? Well, the game has completely changed. Through innovative quantization techniques—essentially compressing models without losing their intelligence—we can now run models that rival GPT-4 and Claude on regular computers.

Take the DeepSeek R1-0528 model we discussed earlier. Originally, it's a massive 671GB model. But through techniques like IQ1_S quantization, it's been compressed to just 185GB—and even further to 131GB with newer methods. That's a 75% size reduction while maintaining performance!

What's remarkable is that these quantized models often perform better than much larger models. For instance, the compressed DeepSeek R1 shows lower perplexity (better performance) than models twice its size. And with distilled versions like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, you can run advanced AI on just 20GB of RAM, achieving 8 tokens per second—fast enough for real-time interaction.

This isn't just about saving space. It's about privacy, control, and access. You can now run AI that understands your entire codebase, analyzes sensitive documents, or helps with creative projects—all without sending data to the cloud."

###### VISUAL

**Slide Title: "The Quantization Revolution: Big AI on Small Hardware"**

- What is Quantization?
  - Compressing AI models while preserving intelligence
  - Like MP3 for AI - smaller size, minimal quality loss
- Recent Breakthroughs:
  - DeepSeek R1: 671GB → 131GB (80% reduction)
  - Performance often improves with quantization
  - Runs on consumer hardware (128GB RAM systems)
- Practical Impact:
  - Privacy: Your data never leaves your computer
  - Speed: No internet latency
  - Cost: One-time hardware investment vs. ongoing API fees
- Visual: Before/After comparison showing model sizes and hardware requirements

###### NOTES

- Key quantization methods: IQ1_S, TQ1_0, Q8_0, Q4_0
- Hardware requirements: 128GB RAM + 24GB VRAM for large models, 20GB RAM for distilled versions
- Community tools: Ollama for easy installation, HuggingFace for model access
- Performance metrics: Perplexity (lower is better) used to measure quality
- Real-world speed: 0.5 tokens/second → 8+ tokens/second with optimization
- **June 2025 Breakthrough**: Parameter-efficient finetuning achieves ~4x more knowledge uptake and 30% less catastrophic forgetting compared to full finetuning and LoRA, using fewer parameters

#### 8.3. Hands-On Application

##### [seq:370] Hands-On Activity: AI Tool Integration Workshop

###### SCRIPT

Before we finish, it’s your turn.
Over the last four lectures, we’ve explored dozens of AI tools, prompting techniques, and system integrations.
Now, I’d like you to pick a real-world task—something useful, something fun, something you’d love to solve—and apply what you’ve learned.

This is not just a technical exercise. It’s a creative challenge:

- Can you combine tools across categories?
- Can you guide an AI system with clarity and precision?
- Can you make something you didn’t think you could?
You’ll work solo or in small groups. In 30–45 minutes, you’ll design a workflow, test it, and share what you created—or what broke along the way.
Because learning to fail with AI is just as important as learning to use it.
