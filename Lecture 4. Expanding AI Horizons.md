# Lecture 4. 
### 1. Introduction: Recap and What's Next

#### 1.1. Script
Welcome back, everyone, to our final lecture in the Basic AI Course—and congratulations for making it this far!

Over the last three sessions, we’ve taken quite a journey together.

In Lecture 1, we met the AI giants—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Mistral—and we also met their flaws. From biases to hallucinations, we learned to question AI rather than blindly trust it.

In Lecture 2, we flipped the lens—exploring real-life tasks where AI shines. We wrote essays, debugged code, translated idioms, and even analyzed visuals. We learned how to use the tools.

Then in Lecture 3, we peeked under the hood: exploring advanced UI features, reasoning chains, system prompts, and even multi-agent models.

Today is where it all comes together.
We’re going beyond the UI—into the backstage of AI systems:
- You’ll learn how to use LLM APIs to build and automate
- You’ll explore benchmarking and prompt precision techniques
- You’ll meet specialized AI tools like NotebookLM, Gamma, and HeyGen
- And we’ll discuss how to keep up with AI's rapid evolution

This lecture is your launchpad—so that you not only understand today’s tools but can adapt to tomorrow’s.

Let’s get started.

#### 1.4. Demonstration (Optional Warm-Up)

**Title:** "How Precise is ChatGPT Today?"
**Prompt:**
```TeXt
Write an essay on the Titanic that is *exactly* 300 words. Do not present the answer until you’ve confirmed it meets the word count. If it’s not exact, revise and count again.

```
**Instructions**:
- Run in ChatGPT Pro or GPT-4o.
- If it overshoots, revise live to show the edit loop.
- Show how we can use `https://wordcounter.net/` to double-check results.

**Discussion Prompt**:
> "This might seem pedantic—but in technical writing, compliance, and academia, word count precision *matters*. How do you think AI performs when we force it to follow rigid constraints?"

### 2. Understanding APIs and LLM Integration

#### 2.1. Script
To really unlock the power of modern AI, we need to go beyond the chatbot interface and step into the world of APIs.
So what exactly is an API?
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a universal translator between your code and someone else’s service—in this case, a powerful AI model running on a remote server.
With just a few lines of code or even a no-code tool, you can:
- Send a prompt to GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, or Mistral
- Customize its behavior with parameters
- Get back structured data, completions, or summaries in seconds
This is what powers real-world applications—from customer service bots to automated legal summarizers to AI-powered dashboards.
Let’s look at the OpenAI Playground and Anthropic Console—these are visual front-ends for the APIs that let us tinker with models without writing any code.
We'll explore key parameters like:
- Temperature: controls randomness
- Max Tokens: caps the response length
- Top-p: narrows the sampling universe
- System prompts: secretly guide how the model behaves
Whether you're building a startup or a hobby project, understanding these controls is your first step toward AI integration mastery.

### 3. Advanced Prompt Crafting Techniques

#### 3.1. Script
Welcome to the art and science of precision prompting.
Up until now, we’ve been writing prompts like casual messages to an assistant. But with the right techniques, prompts can become precise instructions—like code.
Why is this important?
Because the moment you rely on AI for structured outputs—whether for reports, essays, code, or data—you need control.
In this section, we’ll focus on three areas:
1. Word count mastery – how to make the model hit exact lengths, like 300 or 5000 words
2. Token awareness – how to think like the model by understanding its building blocks
3. Prompt wizardry – clever structures that force better reasoning or formatting

Let’s dive into some prompt magic that would make even Hogwarts jealous.
---

#### 3.2. Slide

**Slide Title: "Precision Prompting: When Words Matter"**

| Technique           | Description                                         | Use Case                        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Word Budgeting      | Telling the model to write exactly N words          | Essays, compliance, SEO         |
| Token Awareness     | Understanding how models break down text            | Avoiding truncation             |
| Segmented Prompting | Breaking large tasks into chunks for better control | Long reports, code blocks       |
| Prompt Wizardry     | Embedding hidden logic or rules into prompts        | Structured outputs, QA, scoring |

### 4. AI Arena & Benchmarking

#### 4.1. Script

It's time to bring out the big guns.
So far, we've explored prompt design and integration… but how do we actually compare models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral?
Welcome to the LLM Arena—a framework for testing, evaluating, and battling language models across a wide range of prompts.
Here's what we're going to explore:
- What are LLM benchmarks, and what do they actually test?
- How can you set up mini-benchmarks for your own tasks?
- What can tools like LLM Arena show us that casual use can’t?
We’ll go hands-on with prompt matchups—comparing speed, accuracy, tone, and creativity.
Think of it as the World Cup for AI.

### 5. Advanced AI-Enhanced Image Editing

#### 5.1. Script
Let’s take a break from text and look at the visual side of AI.
While most people associate image generation with tools like Midjourney or DALL·E, there's another powerful angle: image editing with AI using code.
One of the most versatile tools for this is the Pillow library—also known as PIL. It’s like Photoshop’s nerdy cousin: no fancy UI, but total control.
What’s exciting is that we can prompt ChatGPT to write Pillow scripts that apply filters, transformations, and artistic styles—without needing to touch Photoshop.
In this section, we’ll:
- Convert images to greyscale, pixelated, or sepia
- Add dramatic effects like vignettes and Ben-Day dots
- Try out some artistic transformations like oil painting or retro pixel art
You’ll see how generative AI can collaborate with code to unlock creativity in a whole new way.

#### 7.5. Discussion Prompt

> “How could you apply this approach to your work? Think reports, training, newsletters, strategic briefs. Where would AI pipelines save you the most time—or unlock something you didn’t think was possible?”

---
Here we go — Section 8 is all about *depth*. This is your “go big or go home” moment, showing how students can use AI to generate **longform, structured, expert-level research** — with a tight budget and no team of interns.

---

### 8. Deep Research Techniques on a Budget

#### 8.1. Script
Let’s say you need to produce a 10,000-word report on a complex topic.
Traditionally, this would take a research assistant a week or two, maybe more.
But with the right prompts and workflows, AI can generate detailed, well-organized longform content that is surprisingly coherent and structured — if you guide it correctly.
In this section, we’ll focus on using tools like Perplexity, Claude, and even ChatGPT to:
- Find reliable, cited information
- Structure long documents with academic formatting
- Respect word budgets and adjust dynamically
- Incorporate planning, reflection, and correction loops

And yes — we’ll even attempt a 10,000-word research draft.
This isn’t just about speed. It’s about accuracy, structure, and credibility without expensive subscriptions or massive tool stacks.
---

#### 8.2. Slide

**Slide Title: "Longform AI Research: Big Output, Low Budget"**

**Prompt Base** (`BaiL4Pr6`):

> Start with this instruction to Claude or ChatGPT:
```plaintext
You are Perplexity, a helpful deep research assistant. Write a 10,000-word structured academic report on:
“The Social Impact of the Titanic Disaster on the 20th Century”
Follow these formatting guidelines:
- Markdown headers
- 5+ major sections with subsections
- Minimum 10,000 words
- Citations from real sources
- Formal, academic tone
```

**Instructions**:

- Show how the model starts building:
	- Title
	- Abstract
	- Intro
	- First body sections
- Emphasize section-by-section editing, manual word tracking, and source referencing
- You don’t need to finish the whole essay live — just show the **scaffolding and word budgeting in action**

---

##### 8.4.2. Bonus: Claude + Perplexity Tag Team

**Workflow**:

1. **Perplexity** → Pull citations and summaries
2. **Claude** → Structure them into formatted longform Markdown
3. **ChatGPT** → Final edit pass with grammar + clarity polish

---

#### 8.5. Discussion Prompt

> “If AI can write this kind of structured content reliably, where else could we apply it? Internal reports? Policy briefs? Whitepapers? eBooks?”

---

Great — Section 9 is where we go **beyond solo AI models** and enter the world of **multi-agent collaboration**, autonomy, and delegation. This is one of the most forward-looking parts of the lecture — and also one of the most exciting.

---

### 9. Multi-Agent and Autonomous AI Systems

#### 9.1. Script
So far, we’ve been working with one model at a time. But imagine this:
- One AI agent finds data,
- Another summarizes it,
- A third creates visualizations,
- And a final one builds the presentation…
All working together, like a team of digital coworkers.
Welcome to the world of multi-agent systems — where multiple AI agents collaborate to achieve complex tasks.
This isn’t science fiction anymore. Tools like AutoGen, CrewAI, and OpenDevin are bringing agent orchestration into reality.
In this section, we’ll:
- Understand what AI agents are
- See how they can plan, delegate, and communicate
- Watch a simulation of agents building a web app together
This is the early version of something much bigger: autonomous, AI-driven workflows that go way beyond prompting.
---

#### 9.2. Slide

**Slide Title: "Multi-Agent Systems: AI Working as a Team"**

Let’s bring it all together with action and reflection. Sections 11 and 12 are where your students apply what they’ve learned and synthesize it into something meaningful and personal.

---

### 11. Hands-On Activity: AI Tool Integration Workshop

#### 11.1. Script
Before we finish, it’s your turn.
Over the last four lectures, we’ve explored dozens of AI tools, prompting techniques, and system integrations.
Now, I’d like you to pick a real-world task—something useful, something fun, something you’d love to solve—and apply what you’ve learned.

This is not just a technical exercise. It’s a creative challenge:

- Can you combine tools across categories?
- Can you guide an AI system with clarity and precision?
- Can you make something you didn’t think you could?
You’ll work solo or in small groups. In 30–45 minutes, you’ll design a workflow, test it, and share what you created—or what broke along the way.
Because learning to fail with AI is just as important as learning to use it.
